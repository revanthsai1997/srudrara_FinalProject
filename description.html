            <p>
              Do you want to know how to design and program the computers
              powering some of today’s greatest innovations? <br />

              Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is,
              how Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music
              and photos live in the cloud? <br />
              <br />
              Maybe you want to know how computers protect businesses — and
              people — and other cybersecurity issues. <br />
              AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the
              latest ACM/IEEE recommendations and an emphasis on
              high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career in
              computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia
              design or technology architecture.
